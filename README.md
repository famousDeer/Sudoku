# WORK IN PROGRESS
# General info
Hello, this is my first project by my self in python. It's very basic idea of sudoku created with pygame. It include highlighting row and column with a current position of your mouse (you can turn that off).
# :fire: Presentation
## Highlight
Wherever your cursor is pointing, row and column will be highlighted. You can all so disable this future, by clicking in green rectangle.

If you don't put up with mistakes, there is tiny black rectangle with label "Reset". One click and boom, no one saw your mistake.

# :round_pushpin: General info
Hello, this is my first project by my self in python. It's very basic idea of sudoku created using pygame. It include highlighting row and column with a current position of your mouse (you can turn that off). It has also solver to create random new board.

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Reset board
If you don't put up with mistakes, there is tiny black rectangle with label "Reset". One click and boom, no one saw your mistake.
